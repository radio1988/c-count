- !!!RAM reduced to 10G
    - enabled workstation for processing/development
- process images with np.single, save with uint16
    - faster blob_detection, less RAM
- optimized blob-detection params
    - faster wt
- equalization only for blob detection
    - may improve CNN performance
- auto_contrast improved
- skipped edge filter, will use Non_Epo to filter out
    - increased blob_detection speed
    - kept more True clusters



todo:
[ ] package folder structure of ccount
[x] czi tracking system
[ ] classification.py bug (labels wrong), int16 does not have -1? became 65535
[ ] verify if clas.npy.gz contain correct label or 65535
[ ] classifications.py/training.py cleaning
[ ] re-labeling tracking
[ ] use Neg to train
[ ] skip equalization in CNN
[ ] sample size plot
